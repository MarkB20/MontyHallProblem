# Project objectives
trying to disprove the Monty Hall Problem:

what I thought: 50/50

what the problem concluded: 1/3 stay and 2/3 switch 

# The Monty Hall Problem
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The typical setup involves a contestant, three doors, and a host. Here are the basic rules:

1. The contestant initially selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats.

2. After the initial choice, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.

3. the contestant can stick with their initial choice or switch to another unopened door.

4. The contestant wins whatever is behind the chosen door.

The counterintuitive aspect arises in the optimal strategy: statistically, the contestant has a higher chance of winning if they switch doors after the host reveals a goat.

# Conclusion
while creating this program, I assumed that the program would be biased through my opinion. Still, running the program and running the simulation 10 million times, I concluded that my initial instant was wrong and that the maturation who proposed this problem was correct. It is better to switch with 2/3 change rather than 50/50. 

TLDR: the original solution by Mathematicians is right. That is its 2/3 chance when switching.
